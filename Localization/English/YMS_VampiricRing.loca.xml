During combat, the wearer's attacks deal additional necrotic damage equal to one-third of the level, and they absorb damage dealt to replenish their own health. Particularly, when landing critical strikes, it exerts a more potent effect, increasing both the damage dealt and health restored to half the level and granting temporary hit points.</content>
